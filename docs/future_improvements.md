# Iteration Number 2
1. Make the Web App much better
    - Integrate with Tableau Dashboard
2. Try some more ML models to see what the best results will be
    - Especially gradienting boostinggit 
    - Ensemble Models
3. Clean up the HTML files so that they work better
4. Allow multiple investor profiles, api keys, and portfolio ids
5. Move into secondary market
6. Bokeh Dashboard
7. Come up with a framework for testing these things

# Adding the FolioFN API
This is a challenge as we will not have learning models for this. This is going to be somewhat difficult because, even though
there exists a framework for API gets, which is helpful, it is going to be less useful for API put requests.

A solution will be to predict based on the model and use the heuristics used 

# Making a Bokeh Dashboard
Eventually I want to include a bootstrap page that has the notes on one of the pages and the bokeh interaction on the other.

[this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32418045/running-python-code-by-clicking-a-button-in-bokeh) link has a guide on how to make a button that will handle this.
