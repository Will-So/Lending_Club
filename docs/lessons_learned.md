# Lessons Learned
1. Write down a basic example of the tool before I actually get started with the thing. Starting with something complicated is bound to fail even if you think the thing is going to work alright.
4. Never assume that API data will be in the same format as the historical data. 
4. Put the data into its own directory. I didn't forese at the beginning that this project would **generate** so much 
data but this is what ended up happening:

5. Consider using double bar-charts when communicating 2 numbers
6. When presenting, tell either the story of the process or the path the user takes to use the project.
